Problem 5.17 from Java How to Program (11th edition)
An online retailer sells five products whose retail prices are as follows:

Product 1, $2.98; product 2, $4.50; product 3, $9.98; product 4, $4.49 and product 5, $6.87.

Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:

1. product number

2. quantity sold

Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product.

It should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.

Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.
